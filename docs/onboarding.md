# Levvl onboarding

Single flow: everyone does Levvl’s tasks first, then can create their own to share or explore existing ones. Conversational, problem → solution, text-heavy screens.

---

## Principles

- **Conversational, not form:** Screens feel like someone talking to you.
- **Problem first:** Name the struggle, then “here’s how we fix it.”
- **One story:** Levvl’s tasks → then create or explore when ready.
- **Light interaction:** A few choices + name; rest is reading.

---

## Flow summary

| #  | Type     | Role |
|----|----------|------|
| 1  | Text     | Problem (courses/overwhelm) → Levvl’s promise |
| 2  | Text     | Why it works (daily chunk, no backlog) |
| 3  | Text     | What you get (Levvl tasks first, then create/explore) |
| 4  | Input    | Name |
| 5  | Choice   | What’s drawing you here (optional) |
| 6  | Choice   | First focus (Levvl’s task set) |
| 7  | Text     | One task a day, no rush → “here’s your first” |
| 8  | Task     | Day 1 + mark complete |
| 9  | Text     | Win + tomorrow + home |
| 10 | Text     | Create or explore when ready → home |

## Act 1: The problem

### Screen 1 – Welcome (conversational)

**Copy:**

> Most courses never get finished. Long PDFs, big commitments, no rhythm. You want to actually *do* something—not just consume.
>
> Levvl is different. You get one small task a day. Do it, then come back tomorrow. No overwhelm. Just progress.

**CTA:** *Tell me more*

**Purpose:** Name the problem, then one clear promise.

<!-- GROWTH: Alternative problem framings (habits, accountability, community). Consider A/B or segment-specific intros. Localization. -->

---

### Screen 2 – Why it works (the fix)

**Copy:**

> When everything’s in one big doc, it’s easy to quit. When you have one thing to do today—and only today—you actually do it.
>
> Levvl breaks learning and habits into daily steps. You show up, complete the task, and over time it adds up. No catching up. No guilt. Just today’s task.

**CTA:** *I’m in*

**Purpose:** Explain why this fixes the problem.

<!-- GROWTH: Variants for “habit” vs “learning” vs “teaching” angle. Optional short visual (e.g. day 1 → 2 → 3). -->

---

### Screen 3 – What you’ll get

**Copy:**

> So here’s what happens. You’ll get tasks from Levvl to start—short, focused, a few days at a time. You do today’s, mark it done, and tomorrow you get the next one.
>
> Later, you can create your own to share with your audience, or explore courses others have made. But first: you try it yourself.

**CTA:** *Get started*

**Purpose:** Set expectation: Levvl’s tasks first, create/explore later.

<!-- GROWTH: Add “invite friends” or “join a community” when those exist. Link to help/FAQ if needed. -->

---

## Act 2: Light personalization

### Screen 4 – Name

**Copy:**

> Quick question—what should we call you?

**Input:** First name  
**CTA:** *Continue*

**Purpose:** Personalization; used in app (e.g. “Hi, [Name]”).

<!-- GROWTH: Optional “preferred pronoun” or display name vs legal name. Sync with auth profile. -->

---

### Screen 5 – What you’re here for (optional)

**Copy:**

> And what’s drawing you to this—structure, learning something new, building a habit, or sharing what you know?

**Options (single choice):**

- *I need structure and small steps*
- *I want to learn something new*
- *I want to build a habit*
- *I want to share what I know*

**CTA:** *Next*

**Purpose:** Intent for personalization; still one flow for everyone.

<!-- GROWTH: More options (e.g. “stay accountable,” “connect with my audience”). Use to tailor home/explore or email content. Consider skip. -->

---

## Act 3: How it works + first task

### Screen 6 – Your first focus

**Copy:**

> We’ll give you a short set of tasks to start—a few days, one theme. Pick what you want to work on first. You can always add more later.

**Options (Levvl’s own task sets):**

- *Get moving*
- *Clear your head*
- *Learn something new*
- *Build a routine*

**CTA:** *Let’s go*

**Purpose:** Commit to one Levvl course; sets first task content.

<!-- GROWTH: More Levvl courses (e.g. “Write more,” “Mindfulness,” “Stay consistent”). Categories. “Shuffle / surprise me.” Course length (3 vs 5 vs 7 days). -->

---

### Screen 7 – Before your first task

**Copy:**

> Perfect. You’re going to get one task per day for this. No need to rush. No need to catch up. Just do today’s when you can, then come back tomorrow for the next.
>
> Here’s your first one.

**CTA:** *Show me*

**Purpose:** Reinforce “one a day, no guilt” before showing the task.

<!-- GROWTH: Optional “remind me” time (notification preference). Skip for returning users who already know. -->

---

### Screen 8 – First task (Day 1)

**Content:** Task title + 1–2 sentence description (from chosen Levvl course).

**CTA:** *I did it* / *Mark complete*

**Purpose:** First win inside the app.

<!-- GROWTH: Rich task content (media, links). “I’ll do it later” vs “Done.” Optional reflection prompt after complete. -->

---

### Screen 9 – Right after the win

**Copy:**

> Nice, [Name]. That’s day one done. Come back tomorrow and we’ll give you the next task. Your home screen will show your progress and streak when you’re ready to look.

**CTA:** *Take me home*

**Purpose:** Acknowledge win, set “tomorrow,” point to home.

<!-- GROWTH: Show streak counter (0 → 1). Optional share (“I just completed my first task on Levvl”). -->

---

## Act 4: Create or explore

### Screen 10 – What else is here

**Copy:**

> When you’re ready, you can do two other things here. Create your own tasks and short courses to share with your audience—or explore courses and tasks that others have made. Or just keep doing Levvl’s tasks. It’s up to you.

**CTA:** *Go to my home*

**Purpose:** Introduce create/explore; “when you’re ready” keeps it low pressure.

<!-- GROWTH: Deep links to “Create” or “Explore” from here. Highlight one path based on Screen 5 intent. Add “Join a community” or “Invite friends” when available. -->

---

## Growth areas (overview)

| Area | Notes |
|------|------|
| **Problem framings** | Screen 1–2: variants by segment (learner vs creator vs habit). |
| **Levvl courses** | Screen 6: more themes, lengths, “surprise me.” |
| **Intent (Screen 5)** | Use to personalize home, explore, or emails; add/skip options. |
| **Task experience** | Screen 8: media, links, “later,” reflection. |
| **Post-win** | Screen 9: streak, share, reminders. |
| **Create/explore** | Screen 10: CTAs to each path; segment by intent. |
| **Analytics** | Track drop-off per screen; A/B copy on 1–3. |
| **Localization** | All copy; keep tone conversational per locale. |
| **Skip / short path** | Consider “Skip to app” or 3-screen variant for repeat visitors. |

## Tone

- Short sentences. “You” and “we.”
- Name the problem before the fix.
- One idea per screen where possible.
- Plain language: “one task a day,” “mark it done,” “come back tomorrow.”
